PROJECT :- face recognition by GUI
libraries :-


1.OpenCV: OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a free software library for computer vision and machine learning. It is designed to serve as a common infrastructure for machine learning and computer vision techniques.
It features thousands of efficient algorithms for various applications such as detecting and recognising faces, identifying objects, and so on. We need it to take images with our webcam, and some image processing is required.


2.NumPy: NumPy is a core package for scientific computing in Python that provides a multidimensional array object. It can also execute other mathematical operations, but we only need it to turn our photographs into an array so that we can store the model that has been trained.


Haar Cascade: Haar Cascade is a classifier that is used to detect objects from the source for which it has been trained. The outcome is an XML file containing the training result. Simply put, the Haar Cascade is taught by superimposing a positive image over a series of negative images. Because the training requires a high-end computer, a strong internet connection, and hundreds of training photos, it is done on the server. They use high-quality photos and increase the number of phases for which the classifier is trained to improve the efficiency of the output. To detect the face from our webcam, we need a haar cascade frontal face recognizer.


Python GUI (tkinter): Tkinter is a simple GUI package that allows us to interface with code in a straightforward manner. It is not necessary for you to comprehend how the code works in order to understand it.
